# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Racing Wheel Software Suite. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, rationale, and consequences.

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-0001: Force Feedback Mode Matrix](0001-ffb-mode-matrix.md) - FFB delivery mechanisms and capability negotiation
- [ADR-0002: IPC Transport Layer](0002-ipc-transport.md) - Cross-platform communication between service and clients
- [ADR-0003: OWP-1 Protocol Specification](0003-owp1-protocol.md) - Open Wheel Protocol for device communication
- [ADR-0004: Real-Time Scheduling Architecture](0004-rt-scheduling-architecture.md) - 1kHz timing and RT guarantees
- [ADR-0005: Plugin Architecture](0005-plugin-architecture.md) - Safe and fast plugin system design
- [ADR-0006: Safety Interlocks and Fault Management](0006-safety-interlocks.md) - Comprehensive safety system design

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy `template.md` to `XXXX-title.md` where XXXX is the next sequential number
2. Fill in all sections, especially:
   - Context: What problem are we solving?
   - Decision: What are we doing?
   - Rationale: Why this approach?
   - Consequences: What are the trade-offs?
   - References: Link to specific requirements
3. Submit as PR for review
4. Update status to "Accepted" after approval

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended, but not forbidden
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Guidelines

- ADRs are immutable once accepted - create new ADRs to change decisions
- Reference specific requirement IDs from `requirements.md`
- Include implementation notes for complex decisions
- Add compliance and verification criteria
- Link related ADRs to show decision dependencies

## Tools

- Use `template.md` as starting point for new ADRs
- Validate ADR format with `scripts/validate_adr.py` (if available)
- Generate ADR index with `scripts/generate_adr_index.py` (if available)
