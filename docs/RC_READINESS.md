## Strengths

- **All 17 vendor protocol crates wired into engine dispatch**: Thrustmaster, Logitech,
  Fanatec, Simucube (1 & 2), Simagic, Moza, Asetek, VRS, Heusinkveld, AccuForce,
  OpenFFBoard, FFBeast, Leo Bodnar, Cube Controls, Cammus, and PXN — each with unit,
  snapshot, property, and E2E tests plus a dedicated fuzz target.
- **All 14 HID protocol crates have deep tests**: comprehensive coverage including Moza,
  Fanatec, Thrustmaster, Logitech, SimuCube, OpenFFBoard, AccuForce, Asetek, Button Box,
  Cammus, Cube Controls, FFBeast, Leo Bodnar, and VRS — all cross-verified against
  community sources (kernel drivers, pid.codes, vendor documentation) in waves 31-33.
- **All telemetry adapters have deep tests**: AMS2, SimHub, KartKraft, MudRunner,
  Rennsport (wave 25), F1, Forza, LFS, RaceRoom, WRC (wave 26), iRacing, ACC, BeamNG,
  DiRT Rally, ETS2, GT7 (wave 27) — complete adapter coverage.
- **PXN protocol crate** (`hid-pxn-protocol`): VID `0x11FF`, 5 devices (V10, V12, GT987,
  and 2 additional models) — web-verified against Linux kernel `hid-ids.h`.
- **GT7 extended packet support**: 316/344-byte PacketType2 and PacketType3 implemented,
  adding wheel rotation, sway/heave/surge, energy recovery, and filtered throttle/brake.
- **Comprehensive proptest coverage**: all 17 protocol crates have property-based testing
  with 820+ proptest cases exercising encoding round-trips, ID mappings, and safety invariants.
- **56 telemetry adapter modules** with snapshot regression tests across
  multiple schema versions (v2–v9).
- **CLI, schemas, plugins, and engine** all have dedicated test suites.
- **Fuzz testing** covers 104 targets spanning all protocol parsers and telemetry decoders.
- **Safety-critical paths** (FMEA, watchdog, hardware watchdog) have dedicated test suites
  including fault-injection and property tests, with watchdog/FMEA deep tests added in wave 25.
- **RC-specific integration tests** exist (`rc_integration_tests.rs`, 48 tests).
- **Golden-packet integration tests**: 6 telemetry adapters validated against known-good packet captures.
- **Safety soak testing**: 10K+ tick sustained operation suites with fault injection verify interlock and watchdog behavior under load.
- **Compile-fail tests**: `trybuild` enforces type-safety invariants at the API boundary — prevents misuse regressions.
- **Schema evolution tests**: forward/backward compatibility verified across multiple schema versions.
- **Doc-tests**: public API examples verified via `cargo test --doc`.
- **Full-stack E2E tests**: end-to-end validation across the complete pipeline (wave 25).
- **Performance gates**: CI-enforced performance validation (wave 25).
- **FFB, calibration, and pipeline deep tests**: comprehensive force feedback coverage (wave 26).
- **Tracing, support, core, and streams deep tests**: infrastructure coverage (wave 27).
- **Device hot-swap simulation tests**: engine hot-swap resilience validated (wave 30).
- **CLI comprehensive E2E tests**: full subcommand coverage with 112 tests (wave 30).
- **Safety property-based invariants**: 23 invariant tests with 256+ cases each (wave 30).
- **Plugin lifecycle and security deep tests**: 99 tests covering WASM/native plugin lifecycle (wave 31).
- **Protocol verification complete**: ALL 14 HID crates cross-verified against community sources — kernel drivers (`hid-fanatecff`, `hid-lg4ff`, `hid-thrustmaster`, `simagic-ff`), `boxflat`, pid.codes, and vendor documentation (waves 31-33).
- **Telemetry adapter constants cross-verified**: 76 tests validating adapter constants against official game APIs (wave 32).
- **FFB pipeline end-to-end tests**: 41 tests covering complete force feedback pipeline (wave 33).
- **Compat and config deep tests**: 133 migration + validation tests (wave 33).

### Individual PID Status

| Device | PID | Status | Notes |
|--------|-----|--------|-------|
| Fanatec GT DD Pro / ClubSport DD | `0x0020` | Confirmed | GT DD Pro and ClubSport DD share PID `0x0020` with CSL DD in PC mode |
| OpenFFBoard (alt) | `0xFFB1` | **SPECULATIVE** | Zero evidence across 5 sources; `0xFFB0` confirmed via pid.codes + firmware |
| Cube Controls | `0x0C73`–`0x0C75` | **UNVERIFIED** | Zero external evidence exists; OpenFlight uses different estimates |
| VRS DFP V2 | `0xA356` | **UNVERIFIED** | DFP uses `0xA355` (kernel mainline); Pedals use `0xA3BE`; V2 PID not in any source |

## Known Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Cube Controls PIDs still provisional | Medium | `0x0C73`–`0x0C75` have zero external evidence; need hardware captures |
| Ed25519 stub needs real implementation | Medium | `signature.rs:111` is a stub; replace before v1.0.0 |
| macOS CI not yet in matrix | Medium | macOS runner not added to GitHub Actions (F-053) |
| Some telemetry adapters need golden-packet tests | Low | 6 of ~56 adapters now have golden-packet tests; remaining adapters use snapshot-only coverage |
| No physical hardware verification yet | Medium | All PIDs verified against docs/kernel sources only, no USB captures |
| No line-level code coverage (e.g., `llvm-cov`) | Medium | Test count is high but uncovered branches are unknown |
| UI crate excluded from test run | Low | `racing-wheel-ui` excluded via `--exclude`; needs separate GUI test strategy |
| Benchmark suite is minimal | Low | Single bench file; RT timing validation relies on CI perf gates |
| Doc-tests not counted | Low | Doc-tests now run and are counted; ~432+ doc-test examples in public API |
| No mutation testing in CI | Low | `mutants.toml` exists but results are stale (`mutants.out.old/`) |
| Ignored tests at 44 | Low | 44 `#[ignore]`-gated tests requiring hardware or platform resources |
