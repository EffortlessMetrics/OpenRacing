# Releasing OpenRacing

This document describes the release process for OpenRacing.

## Release Types

OpenRacing follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **Alpha releases** (`v0.x.0-alpha`): Early development, API may change significantly
- **Beta releases** (`v0.x.0-beta`): Feature complete for the milestone, API stabilizing
- **Release candidates** (`v0.x.0-rc.N`): Final testing before stable release
- **Stable releases** (`v1.0.0+`): Production-ready, backward compatible within major version

## Prerequisites

Before creating a release:

1. **All CI checks must pass** on the `main` branch
2. **CHANGELOG.md must be updated** with all changes for the release
3. **Version in Cargo.toml** must match the release version (base version for prereleases)
4. **Documentation must be current** for any new features

## Creating a Release

### 1. Update CHANGELOG.md

Ensure the `[Unreleased]` section is moved to a new version section:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- New feature description

### Changed
- Changed behavior description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description
```

### 2. Update Version (if needed)

For major/minor releases, update the version in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace.package]
version = "0.2.0"
```

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md Cargo.toml Cargo.lock
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v0.1.0-alpha"
```

### 4. Create Annotated Tag

Create an annotated git tag with a descriptive message:

```bash
# For alpha release
git tag -a v0.1.0-alpha -m "v0.1.0-alpha: First alpha release

Highlights:
- Core FFB engine with 1kHz real-time processing
- Linux HID support via hidraw/udev
- CLI tool (wheelctl) for device management
- Background service (wheeld) for continuous operation
- Safety system foundation with fault detection

See CHANGELOG.md for full details."

# For stable release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0: First stable release

This is the first production-ready release of OpenRacing.

See CHANGELOG.md for full details."
```

### 5. Push Tag

Push the tag to trigger the release workflow:

```bash
git push origin v0.1.0-alpha
```

### 6. Monitor Release Workflow

The GitHub Actions release workflow will automatically:

1. Validate the tag format and version consistency
2. Extract release notes from CHANGELOG.md
3. Build release binaries for Linux (x86_64) and Windows (x64)
4. Create platform-specific packages:
   - Linux: tarball with binaries, systemd service, and udev rules
   - Windows: portable ZIP with binaries
5. Generate SHA256 checksums for all artifacts
6. Create a GitHub Release with all artifacts attached

Monitor the workflow at: `https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/OpenRacing/actions/workflows/release.yml`

## Release Artifacts

Each release includes:

### Linux (x86_64)
- `openracing-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz` - Tarball containing:
  - `wheelctl` - CLI tool
  - `wheeld` - Background service
  - `99-racing-wheel-suite.rules` - udev rules
  - `wheeld.service` - systemd service file
  - `install.sh` - Installation script
  - Documentation (README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG)

### Windows (x64)
- `openracing-{version}-windows-x64.zip` - ZIP containing:
  - `wheelctl.exe` - CLI tool
  - `wheeld.exe` - Background service
  - Documentation (README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG)

### Checksums
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` - Combined checksums for all artifacts
- Individual `.sha256` files for each artifact

## Verifying a Release

Users can verify downloaded artifacts:

```bash
# Linux
sha256sum -c openracing-0.1.0-alpha-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256

# Windows (PowerShell)
$expected = (Get-Content openracing-0.1.0-alpha-windows-x64.zip.sha256).Split()[0]
$actual = (Get-FileHash openracing-0.1.0-alpha-windows-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
if ($expected -eq $actual) { "Checksum OK" } else { "Checksum FAILED" }
```

## Hotfix Releases

For critical bug fixes on a released version:

1. Create a release branch from the tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v0.1.x v0.1.0
   ```

2. Cherry-pick or apply the fix

3. Update CHANGELOG.md with the fix

4. Create a new patch version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "v0.1.1: Hotfix release"
   git push origin v0.1.1
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Release workflow fails

1. Check the workflow logs for specific errors
2. Common issues:
   - Tag version doesn't match Cargo.toml version
   - CHANGELOG.md missing entry for the version
   - Build failures (check CI status before tagging)

### Missing changelog entry

If the release notes are empty, ensure CHANGELOG.md has an entry matching the version:

```markdown
## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15
```

The version in brackets must match the tag version (without the `v` prefix and prerelease suffix).

### Deleting a tag (if needed)

If you need to recreate a tag:

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.1.0-alpha

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0-alpha

# Recreate and push
git tag -a v0.1.0-alpha -m "..."
git push origin v0.1.0-alpha
```

**Note:** Only delete tags that haven't been widely distributed. Once users have downloaded a release, avoid changing it.
